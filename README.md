# My-First-HTML-Assignment-Cohort2026

🎉 **Welcome to my first HTML assignment project!**

Hello! I am a student in the **WebDev Cohort 2026**, and this is my very first project where I built a webpage from scratch. I’m really excited to share it because it's the first time I've used Git to push my code to GitHub!

## 🌟 About This Project

This project is a **basic one-page Resume webpage** that I created as part of my HTML lab assignment. The goal was to practice structuring content clearly and professionally — even with minimal CSS.

The assignment asked me to use a sample profile (in this case, *“John Doe”*) and build out the content using HTML elements.

## 📌 What I Learned

This lab helped me understand several new concepts:

- **HTML Tables:** I learned how to use `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` to format the *Experience* and *Education* sections neatly.
- **Semantic Tags:** I used `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` to organize content properly.
- **Live Server in VS Code:** Helped me instantly see my code changes in the browser — it was fun watching borders and layouts come to life!
- **Git & GitHub:**  
  - I used `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` for the first time.
  - I encountered a *“rejected push”* error and learned how to fix it using **git rebase** — thanks to our instructor, Piyush Sir, for explaining Git concepts so clearly!

## 🚀 My Progress So Far

I’ve completed all my HTML labs and am now ready to begin learning **CSS**! It’s been an amazing start to my web development journey.
